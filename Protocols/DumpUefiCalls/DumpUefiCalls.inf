# Driver for dumping boot loader UEFI calls.
#
# By dmazar, 26/09/2012

# Feel free to use it, debug it, extend it, but please report back changes/additions to
# http://www.projectosx.com/
#
# How to use:
#
#  Users of Clover boot manager can just place the driver to appropriate drivers folder
#  (for example /EFI/CLOVER/drivers64). Other users will probably know how to load it.
#
# How it works:
#
#  Driver overrides gBS->StartImage() in order to be able to detect boot loader starting (DumpUefiCalls.c).
#
#  When boot loader is about te be started, driver overrides all boot (gBS) and runtime (gRT) services
#  with small wrappers that will call original plartform services and log each call (BootServices.c, RuntimeServices.c).
#
#  When ExitBootServices() is called driver will also print UEFI system table (with configuration tables)
#  and UEFI variables (RT vars).
#
#  Logging is done through PRINT definition (Common.h) which gets replaced by LogPrint() (Log.c).
#  Logs can be directed to screen, serial and disk file (LOG_TO_SCREEN, LOG_TO_SERIAL, LOG_TO_FILE in Common.h).
#
#  Logs to serial are interesting when used in VBox (VMWare?, QEmu?) because driver can continue to dump UEFI
#  calls even during runtime phase, after ExitBootServices() and when OS is running.
#  This requires WORK_DURING_RUNTIME to be enabled in Common.h. That is also a reason why is driver made as runtime driver.
#
#  Logs to screen and file work only up to ExitBootServices() because they depend on boot services to be running.
#
#  PRINT_SHELL_VARS in Common.h is set to 0 to avoid dumping of uninteresting shell vars data. Can be set to 1.
